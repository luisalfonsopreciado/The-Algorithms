# 0/1 Knapsack Problem

Given an array `weights` and `values` of length `n`, the objective is to select items such that the sum of the values is maximized and the sum of their weights is less than an input integer `W`.

You are not permitted to divide an item, you can either pick the entire item or not pick it (0/1 property).
