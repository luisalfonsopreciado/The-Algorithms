# Rod Cutting Problem Statement

Given a rod of length `n` inches and an array `prices` that contains prices of all pieces of size smaller than or equal to `n`. Determine the maximum revenue we can achieve by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces.

For Example, if length of the rod is 8 and the prices of the different pieces are given as follows, then the maximum revenue we can achieve is 22 (obtained by cutting the rod into two pieces of length 6 and 2).

```
length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
--------------------------------------------
price    | 1   5   8   9  10  17  17  20
```

Another Example, if the prices are as follows, and the length of the rod is 8, then the maximum revenue one can obtain by cutting the rod into smaller pieces is 24 (this is done by cutting the rod into eight pieces of length 1).

```
length   | 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
--------------------------------------------
price    | 3   5   8   9  10  17  17  20
```
